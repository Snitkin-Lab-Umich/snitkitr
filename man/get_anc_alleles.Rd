\title{Get ancestral state of alleles}
\usage{
get_anc_alleles(tree, mat, seed_int = 1, parallelization)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{rooted tree}

\item{mat}{allele matrix (rows are variants, columns are samples)}

\item{seed_int}{Number to use as seed for future.apply(). Default = 1.}
}
\value{
matrix of most likely ancestral allele for each row in allele matrix and probability that that is the ancestral state
}
